#Approach:
BFS Initialization:

Start the BFS from the beginWord and explore its neighbors, which are the words in wordList that differ by exactly one letter.
Continue exploring level by level, ensuring that each level corresponds to words that can be reached in the next transformation step.
Queue:

Use a queue to keep track of the current word and the number of transformations taken to reach that word.
The queue will store tuples in the form (current_word, level) where level is the number of transformations from beginWord to current_word.
Visited Set:

Maintain a set to keep track of visited words, to avoid cycles and repeated processing of the same word.
Transformation Check:

For each word in the queue, check all possible one-letter transformations. If any of the transformations match endWord, return the current level + 1 (since it represents the number of transformations).
Edge Case:

If endWord is not in wordList, return 0 because it is impossible to transform beginWord to endWord.

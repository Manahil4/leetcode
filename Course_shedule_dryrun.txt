Let's dry-run the provided code with the following dataset:

### Input:
```python
numCourses = 5
prerequisites = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4]]
```

This means:
- Course `0` has prerequisites `1` and `2`.
- Course `1` has prerequisite `3`.
- Course `3` has prerequisite `4`.

### Step-by-Step Dry Run:

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - We first create a dictionary where each course has an empty list of prerequisites.
   - After processing the `prerequisites` input, the dictionary looks like:
   
   ```python
   {
     0: [1, 2],
     1: [3],
     2: [],
     3: [4],
     4: []
   }
   ```
   - This shows that:
     - Course `0` depends on courses `1` and `2`.
     - Course `1` depends on course `3`.
     - Course `3` depends on course `4`.
     - Courses `2` and `4` have no prerequisites.

2. **DFS Exploration:**

   We initialize two sets:
   - `visit_set`: To track the courses being visited in the current DFS call to detect cycles.
   - `checked`: To track courses that have been fully processed without finding a cycle.

   Now we begin DFS for each course.

### Course `0`:

- We check course `0`:
  - Itâ€™s not in `visit_set` or `checked`, so we add it to `visit_set`: `visit_set = {0}`.
  - We then check its prerequisites `[1, 2]`.

#### Prerequisite `1` (of course `0`):
- For course `1`:
  - It's not in `visit_set` or `checked`, so we add it to `visit_set`: `visit_set = {0, 1}`.
  - We then check its prerequisite `[3]`.

#### Prerequisite `3` (of course `1`):
- For course `3`:
  - It's not in `visit_set` or `checked`, so we add it to `visit_set`: `visit_set = {0, 1, 3}`.
  - We then check its prerequisite `[4]`.

#### Prerequisite `4` (of course `3`):
- For course `4`:
  - It's not in `visit_set` or `checked`, so we add it to `visit_set`: `visit_set = {0, 1, 3, 4}`.
  - Course `4` has no prerequisites, so we remove it from `visit_set` and add it to `checked`: `checked = {4}`, `visit_set = {0, 1, 3}`.
  - We return `True` to indicate that course `4` can be completed.

#### Returning to course `3`:
- All prerequisites of course `3` are satisfied (course `4` has been processed).
- We remove course `3` from `visit_set` and add it to `checked`: `checked = {3, 4}`, `visit_set = {0, 1}`.
- We return `True` to indicate that course `3` can be completed.

#### Returning to course `1`:
- All prerequisites of course `1` are satisfied (course `3` has been processed).
- We remove course `1` from `visit_set` and add it to `checked`: `checked = {1, 3, 4}`, `visit_set = {0}`.
- We return `True` to indicate that course `1` can be completed.

#### Prerequisite `2` (of course `0`):
- For course `2`:
  - It's not in `visit_set` or `checked`, so we add it to `visit_set`: `visit_set = {0, 2}`.
  - Course `2` has no prerequisites, so we remove it from `visit_set` and add it to `checked`: `checked = {1, 2, 3, 4}`, `visit_set = {0}`.
  - We return `True` to indicate that course `2` can be completed.

#### Returning to course `0`:
- All prerequisites of course `0` are satisfied (courses `1` and `2` have been processed).
- We remove course `0` from `visit_set` and add it to `checked`: `checked = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, `visit_set = {}`.
- We return `True` to indicate that course `0` can be completed.

---

### Courses `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`:

- We now check courses `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.
  - All of them are already in the `checked` set, so we skip further processing for these courses.

---

### Final Check:

- After checking all courses, there are no cycles, and all courses are successfully completed. Therefore, the function returns `True`, indicating that all courses can be finished.

### Output:
```python
True
```

### Summary of Execution:
1. We built the graph: `{0: [1, 2], 1: [3], 2: [], 3: [4], 4: []}`.
2. DFS explored all courses successfully without encountering cycles.
3. All courses were marked as processed, so the result is `True`.
